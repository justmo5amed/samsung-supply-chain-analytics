## 🎯 Objectives

- Monitor end-to-end supply chain performance in real time
- Identify bottlenecks in supplier lead times, shipment delays, and inventory levels
- Track production quality and defect rates across facilities
- Analyze customer revenue and product profitability
- Enable data-driven decision making for procurement and logistics teams

## 🧮 Key DAX Measures

```dax
-- On-Time Delivery %
On-Time Delivery % = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(COUNT(fact_shipment[shipment_id]), 
    fact_shipment[status] = "Delivered"),
    COUNT(fact_shipment[shipment_id])
) * 100

-- Defect Rate %
Defect Rate % = 
DIVIDE(
    SUM(fact_production[defective_units]),
    SUM(fact_production[quantity_produced])
) * 100

-- Days of Inventory
Days of Inventory = 
DIVIDE(
    AVERAGE(fact_inventory[stock_level]),
    DIVIDE(SUM(fact_sales[quantity_sold]), 731)
)

-- Avg Delay Days
Avg Delay Days = 
CALCULATE(
    AVERAGEX(
        fact_shipment,
        DATEDIFF(
            LOOKUPVALUE(dim_date[date], dim_date[date_key], fact_shipment[ship_date_key]),
            LOOKUPVALUE(dim_date[date], dim_date[date_key], fact_shipment[delivery_date_key]),
            DAY
        )
    ),
    fact_shipment[status] = "Delayed"
)

-- Inventory Turnover Ratio
Inventory Turnover Ratio = 
DIVIDE(
    SUM(fact_sales[total_cost]),
    AVERAGEX(
        VALUES(fact_inventory[date_key]),
        CALCULATE(
            SUMX(fact_inventory, 
                fact_inventory[stock_level] * RELATED(dim_product[unit_cost])
            )
        )
    )
)
```

## 📐 Data Model

The dashboard uses a **Star Schema** design:

```
                    dim_date
                       │
dim_supplier ──── fact_procurement
                       
dim_product ─┬── fact_sales ──────── dim_customer
             ├── fact_inventory ──── dim_facility
             ├── fact_production ─── dim_facility
             └── fact_shipment ───── dim_customer
                                     dim_facility
```

## 💡 Recommendations Based on Analysis

1. **Switch primary carrier from Maersk Line** — highest delays (87) and 18.86 avg delay days
2. **Investigate January and June shipment delays** — consistently worst months for on-time delivery
3. **Monitor Galaxy Buds2 Pro defect trend** — highest defect rate among products
4. **Diversify customer base** — only 5 customers creates revenue concentration risk
5. **Leverage Vietnam supplier advantage** — Samsung Vietnam has fastest lead time (9 days) and should be prioritized for high-demand products
